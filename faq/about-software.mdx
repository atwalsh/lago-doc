## 3. How is this different from the other billing tools?

Lago is the only open source metering and usage-based billing solution. A lot of closed source (aka ‘SaaS’) solutions exist
(e.g., Chargebee, Stripe Billing, Zuora) but they require you to send your data to third-parties, to blindly trust a
‘black box’ with your most critical internal system (billing / revenue) and they take a cut on your revenue.
Some billing solutions will even force you to only use another of their product, for instance: if you use ‘Stripe Billing’,
you can only use one payment processor, called ‘Stripe Payments’.

We have put together these [product comparisons](https://www.getlago.com/resources/compare/compare-home) if you want to go further.

There are multiple open source billing offerings - Invoice Plane, myBillBook etc. However, Lago is the only open source software that gives you:

1. Real-time event-based usage metering (you won’t need to handle any consumption calculation on your side)
2. Subscription billing
3. Hybrid plans, mixing subscription and consumption (e.g., a usage-based billing plan that requires a recurring minimum spend per month)
4. A full fledge API to automate ‘self-serve/product-led’ plans, and an intuitive no-code user interface to configure ‘custom/enterprise’ plans
5. Additional features including: instant charges, modular couponing, spending minimums, grace periods, etc.
