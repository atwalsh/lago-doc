## 1. Whatâ€™s the community like? 

Lago Community thrives through the active engagement of 6.6K+ users and developers, making it the largest and fastest-growing billing community on GitHub (see [here](https://github.com/getlago/lago)). It serves as the central hub where users and developers can seek support, request features and contribute to the ongoing enhancement of Lago's product.
You can also join hundreds of billing and pricing professionals in our [Slack Community](https://www.getlago.com/slack).

## 2. How can I contribute?

There are many ways to contribute to the Lago community. You can:
- Share your expertise by answering questions on the Lago Community ([Join our Slack](https://www.getlago.com/slack))
- Write blog posts or tutorials about Lago
- Participate in Lago surveys and user interviews

- Report bugs or suggesting improvements ([here](https://github.com/getlago/lago/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md))

For instance, our community played a pivotal role in introducing the "[Latest](https://docs.getlago.com/guide/billable-metrics/aggregation-types/overview)" aggregation type to Lago's product. Additionally, we regularly receive translation contributions from users in languages such as Italian, Spanish, and Norwegian.

Thanks to valuable contributions from our users, our community continues to grow stronger!
