### Establish and finalize connection
<Frame caption="Connect your Lago instance to Salesforce Lago App">
  <img src="/integrations/data/images/salesforce-package-api-connection.gif" />
</Frame>

**Option 1: Configure a standard API Base URL**
To establish a connection between your Lago instance and the Salesforce Package, follow these steps:

1. Access Salesforce and locate the **App Launcher**;
2. Find and open the Lago app you recently installed;
3. Within the Lago Base Configuration tab:
  - Provide your **Lago API Key** (located in Lago's Developer Section)
  - Enter your Lago **API base URL**. Do not insert the `api/v1` at the end of the URL. By default, the valid URL is `https://api.getlago.com/`. 
  If you want to change the API base URL to another one (e.g., `https://api.eu.getlago.com/` or a custom self-hosted one), please follow this [guide](#configure-your-custom-api-base-url).
4. **"Save and validate"** your connection; and
5. Click the **"Start Sync Data"** to finalize the connection between Lago and Salesforce.

<Warning>
Please note that data synchronization is available only for Lago customers with an `external_salesforce_id` and an existing Salesforce Account.
</Warning>

**Option 2: Configure a custom API Base URL**
If you use your own Lago API base URL (self-hosting) or one for a different server instance, 
you can customize it directly in Salesforce: 
1. Navigate to Salesforce's Setup;
2. Search for and select Remote Site Settings;
3. Find and access the remote site for the Lago App;
4. Click the Edit button to modify the remote site's details;
5. Update the Remote Site URL with your preferred URL; and
6. Save the changes.

## II. Sync data from Lago to Salesforce
If your webhook endpoint is configured correctly, your **billing data will flow seamlessly in real-time**.

### Sync Lago customers to Salesforce
To synchronize Lago Customer data with Salesforce Accounts (native object), ensure that your 
Salesforce Account is created first, and that the Lago Customer's `external_salesforce_id` is explicitly populated.

1. Begin by creating a new Account in Salesforce or accessing an existing one;
2. Next, create a customer in Lago and populate the `external_salesforce_id` field for a Lago Customer with the Salesforce Account Id; and
3. Finally, your Salesforce Account and Lago Customer are synchronized!

<Warning>
Billing data will not sync unless these requirements are met. 
Lago does not create Salesforce Accounts.
Before syncing billing data, you need to create or retrieve an existing Account in Salesforce 
and populate the Lago customer field called `external_salesforce_id`.
</Warning>
