## RestLET script configuration
Lago's native integration with NetSuite utilizes a [custom RESTlet script](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_4618456517.html) to provide maximum flexibility in fetching or pushing billing data. To set up the Lago RESTlet script in your NetSuite instance, follow these steps:

- **Install `ramda.min.js`**: this library is mandatory for using Lago's script. Ensure it is installed in your NetSuite instance;
- Create a new script in NetSuite: navigate to **Customization > Scripting > Scripts > Create a New Script**;
- **Paste the script provided by your Lago Account Manager** into the new script; and
- **Deploy the Script**: after creating the script, deploy it within NetSuite.

By deploying this script, you'll generate a custom endpoint that is crucial for the authentication process and enables seamless data synchronization between Lago and NetSuite.

## Connecting Lago to NetSuite
To fully integrate Lago with NetSuite, start by connecting your Lago instance to a new NetSuite connection. 
You can have an unlimited number of NetSuite connections. First, link your NetSuite account to Lago. 
Once connected, activate the specific syncs and actions required for your use case. 
This ensures that your Lago instance is properly configured to communicate with NetSuite, enabling seamless data synchronization and management.

### Create an oAuth app in NetSuite
After logging into your NetSuite account, navigate to **Setup > Integration > Manage Integrations > New**. 
Enter the required integration details and follow these steps:

- Under Authentication, select **Token-based Authentication**;
- Enable the scopes for `RESTlets` and `REST Web Services`; and
- Save you new oAuth integration.

The Client Credentials will be displayed. Copy the Consumer Key/Client ID and Consumer Secret/Client Secret and save them in a secure document for future reference, as this information will not be accessible once you leave the screen.

### Authentication flow
The authentication process connects Lago and NetSuite through OAuth2. 
To establish this connection, you need to provide the following mandatory fields:

- **Connection Name:** an internal name for the connection within Lago;
- **Unique Connection Code:** an internal code for the connection within Lago;
- **NetSuite Account ID:** your NetSuite [account identifier](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_1498754928.html#:~:text=You%20can%20find%20your%20NetSuite,an%20underscore%2C%20for%20example%20123456_RP.);
- **NetSuite Client ID:** the [client ID](/integrations/accounting/netsuite#create-an-oauth-integration-in-netsuite) from your NetSuite account;
- **NetSuite Client Secret:** the [client secret](/integrations/accounting/netsuite#create-an-oauth-integration-in-netsuite) from your NetSuite account;
- **Custom RESTlet Endpoint:** The endpoint created from the [custom RESTlet script](/integrations/accounting/netsuite#restlet-script-configuration).

### Enable actions and syncs
Here is a list of syncs and actions that Lago uses with NetSuite. Some are mandatory, while others are optional:

- `Accounts`: Fetch account data from NetSuite *(mandatory)*;
- `Customers`: Syncs or fetch customer data from NetSuite *(mandatory)*;
- `Items` and `Tax Items`: Fetch item and tax item data from NetSuite *(mandatory)*;
- `Invoices`: Syncs invoice data to NetSuite *(mandatory)*;

## Mapping items between Lago and NetSuite
To sync invoices, credit notes, sales orders, and payments to NetSuite, Lago establishes a one-to-one relationship between Lago objects and NetSuite objects. 
Follow these steps to map an item:
- **Access a NetSuite Connection in Lago:** navigate to your connected NetSuite integration within the Lago platform;
- **Select the Item to map:** click on the specific item in Lago that you wish to map to a corresponding NetSuite item;
- **Fetch Items from NetSuite:** Lago will automatically retrieve the relevant items from your NetSuite instance;
- **Map the Item:** choose the appropriate NetSuite item from the list provided by Lago; and
- **Click 'Save'** to finalize the mapping.

### Mapping a fallback item (mandatory)
The fallback item is a dummy item used as a backup in case the mapping of other objects fails. 
To ensure continuous data synchronization between Lago and NetSuite, this fallback item will be used whenever there is a mapping issue.

<Info>
This mapping follows a one-to-many structure, meaning that a single fallback item can be used to handle multiple mapping issues.

### Mapping a tax item (mandatory)
To override the tax amount for an invoice, sales order, or credit note, you need to map a single tax item from NetSuite. 
This mapped item will be used to assign the correct tax amount.

<Info>
This mapping follows a one-to-many structure, meaning that a single tax item can be mapped to override all tax amounts issued by Lago.
