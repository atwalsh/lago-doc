## Connecting Lago to Xero

To fully integrate Lago with Xero, start by connecting your Lago instance to a new Xero connection. 
You can have an unlimited number of Xero connections. First, link your Xero account to Lago. 
Once connected, activate the specific syncs and actions required for your use case. 
This ensures that your Lago instance is properly configured to communicate with Xero, enabling seamless data synchronization and management.

1. In Lago, navigate to **Integrations > Xero**;
2. Create a **new Xero connection**;
3. Assign a unique **name** and **code** to the connection; and
4. Use OAuth2 to **grant access** to your Xero instance.

There you go, Lago is fully connected to Xero!

## Mapping items between Lago and Xero
To sync invoices, credit notes and payments to Xero, Lago establishes a one-to-one relationship between Lago objects and Xero objects. Follow these steps to map an item:
- **Access a Xero Connection in Lago:** navigate to your connected Xero integration within the Lago platform;
- **Select the Item to map:** click on the specific item in Lago that you wish to map to a corresponding Xero item;
- **Fetch Items from Xero:** Lago will automatically retrieve the relevant items from your Xero instance;
- **Map the Item:** choose the appropriate Xero item from the list provided by Lago; and
- **Click 'Save'** to finalize the mapping.

### Mapping a fallback item (mandatory)
The fallback item is a dummy item used as a backup in case the mapping of other objects fails. 
To ensure continuous data synchronization between Lago and Xero, this fallback item will be used whenever there is a mapping issue.

<Info>
This mapping follows a one-to-many structure, meaning that a single fallback item can be used to handle multiple mapping issues.
</Info>

### Mapping a payment account (mandatory)
To synchronize invoice payments between Lago and Xero, ensure that at least one payment account is mapped.

To set up a payment account in Xero, follow these steps:
1. Log in to your Xero instance;
2. Navigate to **Accounting > Chart of Accounts**;
3. Select an existing revenue account or create a new one; and
4. When editing or creating the account, ensure the **'Enable payments to this account'** checkbox is selected.

In Lago, you can now map it in the dedicated section '**Account linked to payments**'.

### Mapping custom objects
Billable metrics and add-ons require a one-to-one mapping. Each billable metric, used for usage-based billing, must represent a specific SKU in your Xero instance. 
You need to map each of these individually. Lago will use the mapped items whenever any of these metrics or add-ons appear on the final invoice sent to Xero.

<Info>
This mapping follows a one-to-one structure, meaning each billable metric or add-on must be mapped to a specific Xero item.
