  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    To terminate an active subscription through the user interface:
    1. Access the **"Customers"** section via the side menu;
    2. Select a customer from the list;
    3. In the **"Overview"** tab, select an active subscription; and
    4. Click **"Terminate subscription"**; and to terminate an active subscription.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Terminate an active subscription
      LAGO_URL="https://api.getlago.com"
      API_KEY="__YOUR_API_KEY__"
      EXTERNAL_ID="__YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID__"

      curl --location --request DELETE "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/subscriptions/$EXTERNAL_ID" \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"

    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

When a subscription is terminated:
- Lago automatically generates an invoice for any outstanding usage-based charges that have not been invoiced yet;
- If the subscription fee for the plan has been paid in advance, Lago automatically issues a credit note for the unused number of days.

## Terminate a pending subscription

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    To terminate a pending subscription through the user interface:
    1. Access the **"Customers"** section via the side menu;
    2. Select a customer from the list;
    3. In the **"Overview"** tab, select a pending subscription (subscription set in the future or pending downgrade); and
    4. Click **"Terminate subscription"**; and to cancel a pending subscription subscription.
    
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Terminate a pending subscription
        LAGO_URL="https://api.getlago.com"
        API_KEY="__YOUR_API_KEY__"
        EXTERNAL_ID="__YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID__"

        curl --location --request DELETE "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/subscriptions/$EXTERNAL_ID?status=pending" \
          --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

    <Warning>
      To ensure the termination of a pending subscription, it is crucial to include the `?status=pending` filter in your endpoint. 
      Neglecting to do so will render any termination attempts ineffective.
