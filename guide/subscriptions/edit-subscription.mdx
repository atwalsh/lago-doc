Once a plan has been assigned to a customer, whether it's in a pending or active state, you can make edits to the subscription by following these steps:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
  1. Click on the three dots menu icon and select "Edit subscription."
  2. Subscription Start and End Date   
  You have the ability to modify the subscription start date if the subscription is pending, and if the chosen date is later than today. It's important to refer to the [guidelines for subscription start date](https://docs.getlago.com/guide/subscriptions/assign-plan#subscription-start-date) for further information.  
  3. Subscription End Date   
  You can also make changes to the subscription end date, but it's important to refer to the [guidelines for subscription end date](https://docs.getlago.com/guide/subscriptions/assign-plan#subscription-end-date) for further information.
  4. You can edit any prices listed for a subscription, including charges, commitments, tiers and spending minimums.
