## Grouping with a single key[](#grouping-with-a-single-key "Direct link to heading")


Consider the following example:

<Accordion title="Single group example" defaultOpen="false" >
  Your company provides DevOps services and you want to charge your customers
  for compute capacity by the hour.

  In your Lago account, you create a `compute` billable metric that calculates
  the total number of hours (i.e. `SUM(properties.hours)`).

  As your customers can choose from different cloud providers, you need to group
  usage records (i.e. events) according to the provider.

  On the configuration page of your billable metric, you can define
  `"key": "provider"` and `"values": ["AWS","Google","Azure"]` to create the
  corresponding dimension (see snippet below).

    2. Click and expand the section **Define groups in this billable metric**; and
    3. Add groups following the JSON structure below.
    ```json
    {

      "values": ["AWS", "Google", "Azure"]
    }

      Here are few examples of billable metrics you can create:
      <CodeGroup>
        ```bash Storage example with a single group
        LAGO_URL="https://api.getlago.com"
        API_KEY="__YOUR_API_KEY__"

        curl --location --request POST "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/billable_metrics" \
          --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
          --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          --data-raw '{
            "billable_metric": {
              "name": "Storage",
              "code": "storage",
              "description": "Number of GB used",
              "aggregation_type": "sum_agg",
              "field_name": "gb",

              }
            }
          }'
        ```
      </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Below is an example of an event with a single group for the billable metric described above:

```json Event including a group value
LAGO_URL="https://api.getlago.com"
API_KEY="__YOUR_API_KEY__"

curl --location --request POST "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/events" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "event": {
      "transaction_id": "event_001",
      "external_customer_id": "customer_1234",
      "code": "compute",
      "timestamp": 1668461043,
      "properties": {
        "hours": 0.07,
        "provider": "Azure"
      }
    }
  }'
```

<Warning>
  Values are case-sensitive. If you don't use the exact value when pushing
  events, they will not be taken into account. Following our example: the
  expected value is `"Azure"` and `"azure"` is an invalid value.
</Warning>

## Grouping with two keys[](#grouping-with-two-keys "Direct link to heading")
<Accordion title="Two groups example" defaultOpen="false">
It is also possible to define two levels for grouping events. Following our
previous example:

In addition to their cloud provider, your customers can select their region.

Therefore, you can define `"key": "region"` to add a second dimension (see
snippet below).

When creating a plan, you will then be able to add a [charge](/guide/plans/charges)
for each region available for each provider.

Below is an example of an event including two group values for the billable metric described above:

curl --location --request POST "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/events" \

    "code": "compute",
    "timestamp": 1668461044,
    "properties": {
      "hours": 0.13,
      "provider": "AWS",
      "region": "Europe"
    }
  }
}'
```

You can also create billable metrics with dimensions
[via the API](/api-reference/billable-metrics/create).

## Edit dimensions

You can edit billable metric groups associated with existing subscriptions. 
It's important to note that making changes to these metric groups can have an impact on all plans where this billable metric is defined as a charge. 
Here's an example to illustrate the impact of editing a billable metric:
```json
From Payload A: 
{
  "billable_metric": {
    "name": "gigabyte",
    "code": "gigabyte",
    "aggregation_type": "sum_agg",
    "field_name": "total",
    "group": {
      "key": "region",
      "values": [
        "usa",
        "europe",
      ]
    }
  }
}

To Payload B:
{
  "billable_metric": {
    "name": "gigabyte",
    "code": "gigabyte",
    "aggregation_type": "sum_agg",
    "field_name": "total",
    "group": {
      "key": "region",
      "values": [
        "USA",
        "europe",
        "africa"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note that each group is case-sensitive and has its own `group_id`, upon which Lago bases its logic. 
Here's how Lago handles these changes:
1. Since `"region: europe"` remains the same between both payloads; <br /> its `group_id` remains unchanged.
2. As `"region: usa"` is present in Payload A but not in Payload B; <br /> its `group_id` is removed from the billable metric.
3. As `"region: USA"` is not present in Payload A but is present in Payload B; <br /> its `group_id` will be created in the billable metric.
4. Similarly, as `"region: africa"` is not present in Payload A but is present in Payload B; <br /> its `group_id` will be created in the billable metric.


When this billable metric is associated with charges, editing it will impact all plans where it is defined.
- If an existing `group_id` remains the same (case 1), Lago will retain the group definitions in all associated charges.
- If an existing `group_id` is removed from the billable metric (case 2), Lago will remove the group definition in all associated charges.
- If a new `group_id` is created in the billable metric (case 3 and 4), Lago will not automatically add the new group to all associated charges; you will need to add them manually.
