You can edit billable metric groups associated with existing subscriptions. 
It's important to note that making changes to these metric groups can have an impact on all plans where this billable metric is defined as a charge. 
Here's an example to illustrate the impact of editing a billable metric:
```json
From Payload A: 
{
  "billable_metric": {
    "name": "gigabyte",
    "code": "gigabyte",
    "aggregation_type": "sum_agg",
    "field_name": "total",
    "group": {
      "key": "region",
      "values": [
        "usa",
        "europe",
      ]
    }
  }
}

To Payload B:
{
  "billable_metric": {
    "name": "gigabyte",
    "code": "gigabyte",
    "aggregation_type": "sum_agg",
    "field_name": "total",
    "group": {
      "key": "region",
      "values": [
        "USA",
        "europe",
        "africa"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note that each group is case-sensitive and has its own `group_id`, upon which Lago bases its logic. 
Here's how Lago handles these changes:
1. Since `"region: europe"` remains the same between both payloads; <br /> its `group_id` remains unchanged.
2. As `"region: usa"` is present in Payload A but not in Payload B; <br /> its `group_id` is removed from the billable metric.
3. As `"region: USA"` is not present in Payload A but is present in Payload B; <br /> its `group_id` will be created in the billable metric.
4. Similarly, as `"region: africa"` is not present in Payload A but is present in Payload B; <br /> its `group_id` will be created in the billable metric.


When this billable metric is associated with charges, editing it will impact all plans where it is defined.
- If an existing `group_id` remains the same (case 1), Lago will retain the group definitions in all associated charges.
- If an existing `group_id` is removed from the billable metric (case 2), Lago will remove the group definition in all associated charges.
- If a new `group_id` is created in the billable metric (case 3 and 4), Lago will not automatically add the new group to all associated charges; you will need to add them manually.
