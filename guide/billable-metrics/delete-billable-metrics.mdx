title: "Delete billable metrics"

You may delete a billable metric linked to [charges](/guide/plans/charges) associated
with existing [subscriptions](/guide/subscriptions/assign-plan).

If you do so:

- The events associated with this billable metric, which are assigned to the
  current billing period or linked to `draft` invoices, will be immediately
  deleted;
- The charges associated with this billable metric will be immediately removed
  from all plans and existing subscriptions;
- The charges associated with this billable metric will no longer be included in
  the [current usage](/api/customer-usage/customer-usage-object) of the customers
  concerned; and
- The charges associated with this billable metric will be immediately removed
  from all `draft` invoices linked to these subscriptions.

However, the charges associated with this billable metric will still be included
in all `finalized` invoices linked to these subscriptions.

<Info>
  After deleting a billable metric, you can create a new one using the same
  code. However, past events will not be linked to this new billable metric.
