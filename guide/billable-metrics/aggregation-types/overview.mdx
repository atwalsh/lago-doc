Here is the full list of **aggregation types** officially 
supported by Lago.

| Aggregation      | Description                                                                | Transcription                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **COUNT**        | Count the number of times an incoming event occurs                         | `COUNT(events.code)`                            |
| **SUM**          | Sum a defined property for incoming events                                 | `SUM(events.properties.property_name)`            |
| **MAX**          | Get the maximum value of a defined property for incoming events            | `MAX(events.properties.property_name)`           |
| **UNIQUE COUNT** | Count the number of unique value of a defined property for incoming events | `COUNT_DISTINCT(events.properties.property_name)` |

<Note>Except the `COUNT` (that is counting the number of times an event occurs), the
other types aggregate over a single property of the event. **The result of this
aggregation will be used to charge your customers.**</Note>
