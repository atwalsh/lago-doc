Here is the full list of **aggregation types** officially 
supported by Lago.

| Aggregation      | Description                                                                | Transcription                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **COUNT**        | Count the number of times an incoming event occurs                         | `COUNT(events.code)`                            |
| **COUNT UNIQUE** | Count the number of unique value of a defined property for incoming events | `COUNT_DISTINCT(events.properties.property_name)` |
| **LATEST**       | Get the latest value of a defined property for incoming events             | `LAST_VALUE(events.properties.property_name) OVER ([PARTITION BY events.timestamp])` |
| **MAX**          | Get the maximum value of a defined property for incoming events            | `MAX(events.properties.property_name)`           |
| **SUM**          | Sum a defined property for incoming events                                 | `SUM(events.properties.property_name)`            |
| **WEIGHTED SUM** | Sum a defined property for incoming events, prorated based on time used per period | `SUM(events.properties.property_name) / (DATEDIFF(SECOND, timestamp.event_1, timestamp.event_2) + 1) * (DATEDIFF(SECOND, 'period_start', 'period_end') + 1)`|
| **CUSTOM** | Define a custom code for your aggregation | Custom code |

<Note>Except the `COUNT` (that is counting the number of times an event occurs), the
other types aggregate over a single property of the event. **The result of this
aggregation will be used to charge your customers.**</Note>
