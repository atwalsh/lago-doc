The latest aggregation type selects the most recent value of a specified event property from all received events.

## LATEST billable metric

    Here is how you can create a max aggregation from the UI:
    1. Access the **"Billable metrics"** section via the side menu;
    2. Create a new billable metric;
    3. Define a name, a code and an optional description;
    4. Select **"latest"** as the aggregation type;
    5. Define the property to aggregate;
    6. Apply dimension groups if any; and
    7. Click **"Add billable metric"**.

<Info>
This billable metric is `metered` only, meaning it cannot be recurring, and the number of billing units resets to 0 at the end of each period.

    ```bash

        API_KEY="__YOUR_API_KEY__"

        curl --location --request POST "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/billable_metrics" \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data-raw '{
            "billable_metric": {
            "name": "API Request",
            "code": "api_requests",
            "description": "Number of API requests.",
            "aggregation_type": "latest_agg",
            "field_name": "total_requests",
            "group": {}
        }
    }'
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

## Calculation example
Lago calculates the `LAST_VALUE (events.properties.property_name) OVER ( [PARTITION BY events.timestamp])` for the two following events received. 

```json
//Event received #1
{
    "transaction_id": "transaction_1",
    "external_customer_id": "1",
    "timestamp": "2022-03-16T00:00:00Z",
    "code": "api_requests",
    "properties": {
        "total_requests": 20
    }
}

//Event received #2
{
    "transaction_id": "transaction_2",
    "external_customer_id": "1",
    "timestamp": "2022-03-17T00:00:00Z",
    "code": "api_requests",
    "properties": {
        "total_requests": 10
    }
}
```

In that case, with this aggregation type, Lago takes the latest value of `total_requests` property from all events, **resulting in a billable value of 10 units.**
