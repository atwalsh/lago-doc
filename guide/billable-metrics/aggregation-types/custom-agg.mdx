</Info>

Lago's basic interface and API allow you to configure metrics using conditional statements and predefined functions for usage aggregation. 
However, for more sophisticated metrics, you may require more complex aggregation capabilities than those provided by Lago's default settings. 
To address this need, Lago can parse your custom code, enabling you to implement advanced billing rules and custom aggregation logic.

By using custom code for aggregation, you gain complete flexibility over your usage metrics, allowing you to define and tailor them to your specific requirements. 
This feature empowers you to create bespoke solutions that precisely match your billing needs. 
If you're interested in leveraging custom code aggregation, please contact our team to enable this feature.
