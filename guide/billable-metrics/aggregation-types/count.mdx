The count aggregation type is straightforward. It tallies the exact number of events received during a period.

## COUNT billable metric

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    Here is how you can create a count aggregation from the UI:
    1. Access the **"Billable metrics"** section via the side menu;
    2. Create a new billable metric;
    3. Define a name, a code and an optional description;
    4. Select **"count"** as the aggregation type;
    5. Apply dimension groups if any; and
    5. Click **"Add billable metric"**.

<Info>
   This billable metric is `metered` only, meaning it cannot be recurring, and the number 
   of billing units resets to 0 at the end of each period.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash
        LAGO_URL="https://api.getlago.com"
        API_KEY="__YOUR_API_KEY__"

        curl --location --request POST "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/billable_metrics" \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data-raw '{
            "billable_metric": {
            "name": "API Request",
            "code": "api_requests",
            "description": "Number of API requests.",
            "aggregation_type": "count_agg",
            "group": {}
        }
    }'
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Calculation example
Lago calculates the `COUNT(events.code)` for the two following events received.

```json
//Event received #1
{
    "transaction_id": "transaction_1",
    "external_customer_id": "1",
    "timestamp": "2022-03-16T00:00:00Z",
    "code": "api_requests",
    "properties": {}
}

//Event received #2
{
    "transaction_id": "transaction_2",
    "external_customer_id": "1",
    "timestamp": "2022-03-17T00:00:00Z",
    "code": "api_requests",
    "properties": {}
}
```

In that case, with this aggregation type, Lago simply counts the number events received, **resulting in a billable value of 2 units.**
