title: "Migration to v1.2.0"
---

Dear Lago Community, ðŸ‘‹

We're writing to inform you of upcoming changes in the Lago API that may impact your workflows.

# Why are we doing this?

We understand that change can sometimes be challenging. However, we believe it's essential for growth and improvement.

In our continuous efforts to improve Lago's scalability and flexibility, we are updating our API to streamline the delivery of multiple features. This approach allows us to deliver more value to you and will pave the way for exciting new releases, including:

1. **Infinite Dimension Structure:** With filters, enjoy unlimited depth in dimension structures, enabling you to merge multiple billable metrics into a single event code;
2. **High Usage Ingestion System:** Overcome scalability issues with the ability to send over 10,000 events per second;
3. **Current/Past Usage Performance Improvements:** Experience near-real-time data query with enhanced performance for current and past usage endpoints;
4. **Alerting Scenarios:** Set up custom alerts for critical events such as unpaid invoices, reaching wallet credit thresholds, and many more;
5. **Workflow Creation:** Seamlessly trigger actions within Lago based on custom scenarios, like pausing subscriptions or upgrading plans based on alerts; and
6. **Entitlements Scenarios:** Utilize Lago's aggregated usage data to manage access to product features based on custom rules.

# Timeline

We will maintain the current API logic until **July 9, 2024**. However, after this date, previous versions will no longer be supported. We kindly ask you to update your integration before that day to avoid any potential breaking change.

# What are the changes?

## 1. Transition from `group` to `filters`

We're introducing a new method for building infinite levels of dimensions in Lago with the concept of `filters`.

<Warning>
  Creating or editing billable metrics or plans via the user interface will result in the creation of `filters`.
  Therefore, you may encounter issues if you make changes via the interface but still use `groups` when creating or editing objects via API.
</Warning>

### Impact on billable metrics

- Introducing `billable_metrics.filters`
- Deprecating `billable_metrics.group`

**Deprecating "billable_metrics.group"**
The `group` object is deprecated and will be removed from the `billable_metric` object on July 9, 2024.
Please update all integrations currently using `billable_metrics.group` (see example below).

```diff "billable_metrics.group" with 1 level
{
  "billable_metric": {
    â€¦
-    "group": {
-      "key": "provider",
-      "values": ["AWS", "Google", "Azure"]
-   }
+   "filters": [
+	  {
+	    "key": "provider",
+	    "values": ["AWS", "Google", "Azure"]
+	  }
+	]
  }
}
```

```diff "billable_metrics.group" with 2 levels
{
  "billable_metric": {
    â€¦
-    "group": {
-      "key": "provider",
-      "values": [
-        {
-          "name": "AWS",
-          "key": "region",
-          "values": ["Europe", "Africa", "Asia"]
-        },
-        {
-          "name": "Google",
-          "key": "region",
-          "values": ["Europe", "North America"]
-        },
-        {
-          "name": "Azure",
-          "key": "region",
-          "values": ["North America", "Asia"]
-        }
-      ]
-    }
+    "filters": [
+      {
+        "key": "provider",
+        "values": ["AWS", "Google", "Azure"]
+      },
+      {
+        "key": "region",
+        "values": ["Europe", "Africa", "Asia", "North America"]
+      }
+    ]
  }
}

```

<Warning>
  Note that the billable_metric object will only display filters and groups if
  applicable.
</Warning>

### Impact on API endpoints

- Deprecating `List all billable metric groups`.

The endpoint `List all billable metric groups` is deprecated. It will be supported until July 9, 2024 and will then be removed.

```
GET https://api.getlago.com/api/v1/billable_metrics/{code}/groups
```

### Impact on plans

- Introducing `plans.charges.filters`
- Deprecating `plans.charges.group_properties`

**Deprecating "billable_metrics.groups" with one level**
The `group_properties` object is deprecated and will be removed from `plans.charges` on July 9, 2024.

Please update all integrations currently using `plans.charges.group_properties` (see example below).

```diff
{
  "plans": {
    â€¦
    "charges": [
    {
      â€¦
      "properties": {
        "amount": "0",
      },
-      "group_properties": [
-        {
-          "group_id": "__GROUP_ID__",
-          "invoice_display_name": "AWS in Europe",
-          "values": {
-            "amount": "15",
-          }
-        },
-        {
-          "group_id": "__GROUP_ID__",
-          "invoice_display_name": "Google in Europe",
-          "values": {
-            "amount": "20",
-          }
-        }
-      ]
+      "filters": [
+        {
+          "values": {
+            "provider": "AWS",
+            "region": "Europe"
+          },
+          "invoice_display_name": "AWS in Europe"
+          "properties": { "amount": "15" }
+        },
+        {
+          "values": {
+            "provider": "Google",
+            "region": "Europe"
+          },
+          "invoice_display_name": "Google in Europe"
+          "properties": { "amount": "20" }
+        }
+      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  Note that the plan object will only display filters and group_properties if
  applicable.
</Warning>

### Impact on fees

- Introducing `fees.lago_charge_filter_id`
- Deprecating `fees.lago_group_id`

**Deprecating "billable_metrics.groups" with one level**
The `lago_group_id` field is deprecated and will be removed from `fees` on July 9, 2024.

Please update all integrations currently using `fees.lago_group_id` or `invoice.fees.lago_group_id` (see example below).

```diff
{
  "fees": {
    â€¦
-    "lago_group_id": "1a901a90-1a90-1a90-1a90-1a901a901a90",
+    "lago_group_id": null,
+    "lago_charge_filter_id": "1a901a90-1a90-1a90-1a90-1a901a901a90",
    â€¦
  }
}
```

<Warning>This change also affects the invoice object.</Warning>

### Impact on customer usage

- Introducing `customer_usage.charges_usage.filters`
- Deprecating `customer_usage.charges_usage.groups`

**Deprecating "billable_metrics.groups" with one level**
The `charges_usage.groups` field is deprecated and will be removed from `customer_usage` on July 9, 2024.

Please update all integrations currently using `customer_usage.charges_usage.groups` (see example below).

```diff
{
  "customer_usage": {
    â€¦
    "charges_usage": [
      â€¦
      {
-        "groups": [
-          {
-            "lago_id": "1a901a90-1a90-1a90-1a90-1a901a901a90",
-            "key": "null",
-            "value": "europe",
-            "units": "0.9",
-            "amount_cents": 1000,
-            "events_count": 10
-          }
-        ]
+        "filters": [
+          {
+            "values": {
+              "provider": "AWS",
+              "region": "Europe"
+            }
+            "units": "0.9",
+            "amount_cents": 1000,
+            "events_count": 10
+          }
+        ]
      }
    ]
    â€¦
  }
}
```

## 2. Mandatory `external_subscription_id` field in event payloads

To enable real-time functionalities, event payloads must include `external_subscription_id`.
Events that only include `external_customer_id` will not be taken into account when aggregating usage in upcoming versions.

- Making `events.external_subscription_id` required

**Making "events.external_subscription_id" required**
Sending `event.external_subscription_id` will be mandatory starting July 9, 2024.

Please update all integrations currently using `POST /events` (see example below).

```diff
{
  "event": {
    "transaction_id": "__UNIQUE_ID__",
-   "external_customer_id": "__YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID__",
+   "external_subscription_id": "__YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID__",
    "code": "__BILLABLE_METRIC_CODE__",
    "timestamp": $(date +%s),
    "properties": {
      "custom_field": 12
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Deprecated fields
