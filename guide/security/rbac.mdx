## Admin role
Admins wield full control over Lago, managing billable metrics, plans, customers, subscriptions, settings or financial analysis. 
Typically, developers with admin roles handle all critical billing operations. By default, the account creator is assigned the Admin role.

<Info>
    Only admins can invite new members and assign roles. Your account must always have at least one admin.
</Info>

## Account manager role
The Account manager role suits Sales or Customer Success Managers, enabling them to carry out billing tasks for customers.
Account Managers can assign subscriptions, coupons, add-ons, and override prices but are not permitted to modify metrics or plans.


## Finance & analyst role
The Finance & analyst role is view-only, restricted from creating or editing metrics and plans, or assigning core billing actions such as coupons, 
subscriptions, or one-off invoices. It's ideal for analyzing financial data, reviewing invoices, and issuing credit notes as necessary.
