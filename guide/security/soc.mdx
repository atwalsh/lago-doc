Lago has achieved SOC 2 Type 2 compliance for its fully hosted version, which certifies the effectiveness of our operating and security controls.
Please contact hello@getlago.com to request the full report. Please note that the self-hosted version is compliant by default, as you own the data and the infrastructure.

## Data Security
Lago encrypts data at rest and in transit for all of our customers. We use Amazon Web Serviceâ€™s Key Management System (KMS) to manage encryption keys for maximum security, in line with industry best practices.

## Application Security
Lago also uses Dependabot, a high-quality analysis tooling provided by GitHub Advanced Security, to secure our product at every step of the development process.

## Infrastructure Security
Lago uses Amazon Web Services to host our application. We make use of the security products embedded within the AWS ecosystem, including KMS and GuardDuty.
In addition, we deploy our application using Kubernetes containers run on AWS managed services, meaning we typically do not manage servers or EC2 instances in production.
