## Application scope[](#application-scope "Direct link to heading")

<Info>
You can apply several coupons to a customer. However, if a coupon has been
marked as non-reusable, you will only be able to apply it once to the customer
account, even if it has not been fully consumed. A coupon applied to a customer continues to apply beyond the expiration date.
</Info>

Coupons are deducted from future subscription invoices. As mentioned previously, the value of
the coupon is deducted from the amount of the invoice before tax.

For coupons whose value is a fixed amount:

- **When the coupon only applies once** and its value is higher than the invoice
  amount, the remaining unused amount will be applied to the following invoices,
  until the coupon is totally consumed or removed; and
- **When the coupon is recurring** and its value is higher than the invoice amount,
  any remaining unused amount will be lost, even if it is the last application
  period.

When several coupons are applied to the customer account, they will be deducted according to the following rules:
- **Coupons limited to specific billable metrics will be deducted first** (if any, and if there is at least one subscription 
associated with the relevant metric);
- **Coupons limited to specific plans will be deducted next** (if any, and if there is at least one subscription associated with the relevant plan); and
- **Coupons that apply to all plans** will be deducted according to the date on which they were applied (i.e. the coupon that was applied first will be deducted first).

You can see the remaining value / number of remaining periods for each coupon in
the **"Overview"** tab of the customer view.

<Info>Coupons do not apply to add-ons or any other one-off charges.</Info>

## Edit, terminate and delete coupons[](#edit-terminate-and-delete-coupons "Direct link to heading")

In the coupon view, you can click the **ellipsis icon** to see all available
actions:

1. **Edit**: allows you to modify the name, code and settings of the coupon;
2. **Terminate**: allows you to deactivate the coupon so that it cannot be
   applied to any new customer (customers to whom the coupon has already been
   applied continue to benefit from it); and
3. **Delete**: allows you to delete the coupon and remove it from the list (this
   action cannot be undone).

<Info>
  You cannot modify the code, value and frequency of a coupon, or delete it, if
  it has already been applied to a customer.
</Info>

## Remove coupons[](#remove-coupons "Direct link to heading")

To remove a coupon that has been applied to a customer and is still active:

1. Select the customer;
2. Locate the coupon under **"Overview"**;
3. Click the **bin icon** on the right; and
4. Click **"Remove coupon"** to confirm.

The coupon will instantly disappear from the customer view and will not be
applied to the next invoice.
