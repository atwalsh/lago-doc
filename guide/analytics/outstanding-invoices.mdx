Our dashboard empowers you with insights into the number of invoices and their respective values across all payment statuses.
This means you can easily track the count of invoices with failed, pending, or successful payment statuses.

By simply clicking on any of the rows, you can gain access to a detailed list of invoices categorized by their status.
This feature proves valuable when you need to initiate a new payment intent or take specific actions related to invoice management.
