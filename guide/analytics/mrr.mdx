Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) serves as a crucial indicator of your subscription-based revenue stream.
It encapsulates the total monthly revenue derived from subscriptions that is recurring. It's important to highlight that our MRR calculation
method takes into account all types of coupons and taxes. We take a holistic approach to provide you with an accurate representation 
of your recurring revenue.

It's worth noting that Lago's MRR calculations solely pertain to `subscription` fees. Usage-based metrics,
whether recurring or metered, are not factored into the MRR calculations. This distinction ensures that your MRR figures
specifically reflect your subscription-based revenue, helping you gain a clear understanding of your core financial
performance.

**Here's our MRR calculation method:**

- Revenue from `monthly` subscription invoices is included in the MRR for the month in which the invoice is issued.
- Revenue from `quarterly` subscription invoices is distributed evenly over three months. This distribution applies to fees paid in advance (allocated to the next remaining months depending on calendar or anniversary billing) as well as to fees paid in arrears (allocated to the preceding months depending on calendar or anniversary billing).
- Revenue from `yearly` subscription invoices is distributed evenly over twelve months. This allocation is applicable for fees paid in advance (spread over the next  remaining months depending on calendar or anniversary billing) and for fees paid in arrears (spread over the previous months depending on calendar or anniversary billing).
- Revenue from `weekly` subscription invoices, the total revenue from all invoices issued within a month is summed up. This total is then divided by the number of invoices issued during that month, and the result is multiplied by 4.33, representing the average number of weeks in a month.

<Info>
Please note that the UI's MRR total summary displays the MRR from the most recently **completed** billing month.
