Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) serves as a crucial indicator of your subscription-based revenue stream.
It encapsulates the total monthly revenue derived from subscriptions that is recurring. It's important to highlight that our MRR calculation
method does not take into account all types of discounts, be it credit notes, coupons, or credits. We take a holistic
approach to provide you with an accurate representation of your recurring revenue, before applying any discounts.

It's worth noting that Lago's MRR calculations solely pertain to `subscription` fees. Usage-based metrics,
whether recurring or metered, are not factored into the MRR calculations. This distinction ensures that your MRR figures
specifically reflect your subscription-based revenue, helping you gain a clear understanding of your core financial
performance.

**Here's our MRR calculation method:**

- For `monthly` invoices, we record the revenue during the month of issuance.
- For `yearly` invoices, we evenly distribute the revenue over 12 months. If the invoice is paid in arrears, it's spread across the past 12 months; if paid in advance, it's distributed over the next 12 months.
- For `quarterly` invoices, we divide the revenue equally over 3 months. If paid in arrears, it's allocated to the past 3 months, while if paid in advance, it's distributed over the next 3 months.
- For `weekly` invoices, we calculate the monthly revenue total, divide it by the number of weekly invoices issued, and then multiply by 4.33 (the average number of weeks in a month). This provides an equitable distribution of revenue.
