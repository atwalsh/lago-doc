title: "Gross revenue"
---

Gross revenue represents the total income generated by your organization in a single month, giving you a complete overview of your financial performance.
We ensure a comprehensive approach, encompassing all types of discounts, such as credit notes, coupons, and credits, to provide you with a precise picture of your gross revenue.
In essence, it's the amount you should expect to receive every month.

**Our gross revenue calculation considers the following factors:**

1. All `finalized` invoices, whether related to subscriptions or usage;
2. Pay in advance fees, whether they are invoiceable or not;
3. Invoices related to prepaid credits from wallets; and
4. One-off invoices.
