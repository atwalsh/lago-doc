Invoiced usage represents the quantified value of consumption-based metrics that have been formally invoiced.
This usage can encompass a wide spectrum, including both metered and recurring usage-based metrics.
It doesn't matter whether these charges are settled in advance or in arrears, or whether they involve proration.

It's important to note that usage for the current month is not factored into this calculation.
This omission is due to the inherent uncertainty of current consumption, which hasn't yet been formalized through
invoicing processes.
