Our commitment to delivering valuable insights drives us to regularly expand our suite of revenue dashboards.
These dashboards are not just a feature; they're the very first thing you encounter when you log in to your Lago account,
ensuring you have immediate access to critical financial information. Additionally, users can access this data via our API for seamless integration.

## Currency filter

If you have invoices in multiple currencies, please note that no conversion rate is applied.

## Time filter

Within the user interface, you have the ability to filter metrics based on timeframes. Your options include:

- `Yearly`: Covers the last 12 months
- `Monthly`: Focuses on the current month
- `Quarterly`: Encompasses the past 4 months

At Lago, our analytics dashboards are accessible through both the user interface and dedicated API endpoints.
When interacting with our APIs, you have the flexibility to fine-tune your data retrieval by incorporating currency-based
filters. This means you can seamlessly obtain the insights that matter most to you, all while harnessing the power of
