    To access the Overdue invoices dashboard:

    1. Navigate to the "Analytics" section; and
    2. Access the "Overdue invoices" Dashboard.

    Our overdue balance calculation considers the following factors:

    - Finalized invoices; 
    - With pending or failed as a payment status; and
    - A due date that is past;
 
    It is not taking into account invoices that are disputed or voided.
