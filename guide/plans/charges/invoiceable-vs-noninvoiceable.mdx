Please **[contact us](mailto:hello@getlago.com)** to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.</Info>

If a charge needs to be `paid in advance`, you can choose whether or not it generates an invoice.

The `"invoiceable": false` option is **particularly relevant for fintech companies that want to charge customers instantly 
without issuing an invoice**. This feature can be useful for banking transactions like ATM withdrawals, FX transfers and other 
similar scenarios.

By setting the invoiceable parameter to false, you can streamline the payment process, eliminating the step of generating 
invoices for these specific charges.

To define if a charge is invoiceable or not:

    5. Untick **generate an invoice for each event**.
