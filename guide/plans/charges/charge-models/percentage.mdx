Select the percentage charge model if you want to apply a **percentage and a
fixed fee on transactions** (e.g. bank transfers, ATM withdrawals, etc.).

This charge model is generally used with billable metrics that allow users to
calculate the total amount of transactions (e.g. `sum` aggregation type and
`amount` defined as the event property -
[learn more](/guide/billable-metrics/aggregation-types)).

You can define several parameters for the percentage charge model, including:

- **Percentage rate**: charge rate that applies to the total amount (e.g. 1.2%
    on transactions);
- **Fixed fee (optional)**: fee that applies to each event ingested during the
    billing period (e.g. \$0.10 per transaction);
- **Free units (per event - optional)**: number of events that are not subject to
    the fixed fee;
- **Free units (total amount - optional)**: amount that is not subject to the
    charge rate;
- **Per-transaction spending minimum (per event - optional)**: sets the minimum amount of spending required for each individual transaction; and
- **Per-transaction spending maximum (per event - optional)**: sets the maximum amount of spending required for each individual transaction.

When free units are defined for both the total amount and number of events, Lago
performs checks each time a new event is ingested to determine whether the free
units still apply. In the illustration below for instance, the first 3 events or
\$500 are free.

<Info>**Premium feature âœ¨**: only users with a premium license can define a per-transaction spending minimum and maximum for the percentage pricing model.

Consider the following list of events:

| Event         | Amount | Total number of events         | Total amount       | Result     |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------ | ---------- |
| Transaction 1 | \$200  | 1 free event (out of 3)        | \$200 (\$500 free) | No charges |
| Transaction 2 | \$100  | 2 free events (out of 3)       | \$300 (\$500 free) | No charges |
| Transaction 3 | \$100  | 3 free events (out of 3)       | \$400 (\$500 free) | No charges |
| Transaction 4 | \$50   | 4 events (free units exceeded) | \$450 (\$500 free) | Charge     |

Therefore, for the fourth transaction, the charge will be \$0.10 x 1 event + 1.2%
of \$50 = \$0.70.
