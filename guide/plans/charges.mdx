## Overview of charges[](#overview-of-charges "Direct link to heading")
To incorporate usage-based charges into a plan, you can utilize existing billable metrics. 
This enables you to offer "pay-as-you-go" features.
For instance, you can create charges based on the number of API calls, the
number of active users, transactions, compute time, etc. These additional
charges relate to the [billable metrics](/overview) defined previously.
Here are some important details to consider regarding usage-based charges:


### Currency of charges[](#charges-currency "Direct link to heading")
All charges are denominated in the same currency as the plan to ensure consistency and transparency.

### Trial period exclusions[](#trial-period-exclusion "Direct link to heading")
It's important to note that the trial period exclusively applies to the base amount of the plan and does not extend 
to usage-based charges.

## Number of decimals[](#number-of-decimals "Direct link to heading")

Lago allows you create charges with up to fifteen decimals (e.g.
$0.000123456789123).

Please note that charges are invoiced in `amount_cents`. Therefore, Lago
automatically rounds prices (e.g. USD 1102 `amount_cents` \= $11.02).


## Charges paid in arrears[](#charges-arrears "Direct link to heading")
If you opt for charges to be settled in arrears, they will be invoiced at the end of the billing period based on 
the actual usage during that period. This payment option is ideal for usage types like storage, API calls, or compute, 
where it is more practical to wait until the end of the period before billing. By default, all charges are configured to be 
billed in arrears.

## Charge models[](#charge-models "Direct link to heading")
Here is the full list of usage-based charges pricing models provided by Lago.
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Standard">
      Select the standard charge model if you want to charge the **same price for each
      unit** consumed.

      Imagine that your API company charges $0.05 per API call (i.e. your billable
      metric). By selecting the standard charge model, you will define a fixed unit
      price. If a customer makes 1,000 API calls during the billing period, the total
      invoice amount will be $0.05 x 1,000 API calls = $50.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Graduated">
    Select the graduated charge model if you want to define **several price tiers**.
    This charge model allows you to apply a discount depending on the number of
    units consumed. You can also apply a **flat fee** to an entire tier.

    Let's take back the example of the API company. You could charge $1 per unit for
    the first 100 units (first 100 API calls), then $0.50 per unit for the next 100
    calls and finally, $0.10 for any additional unit.

    Please refer to the tooltip in the user interface for more information.

    <Frame caption="Configuration of the graduated charge model" >
      <img src="/guide/plans/images/graduated-charge-pricing-model-65dd3d428a7a5aaeb486e851adf029e7.png" />
    </Frame>
    
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Package">
      Select the package charge model if you want to apply a **fixed price to a range
      of units**. You also have the ability to offer free units.

      Let's take back the example of our API company. You may want to charge $5 per
      100 units and offer the first 100 units. In this example, 201 units would cost
      $0 (first 100 units) + $5 (next 100 units) + $5 (last unit) = $10.

    <Frame  caption="Configuration of the package charge model" >
      <img src="/guide/plans/images/package-pricing-charge-model-ff1836a27a037aaf14819bbdb70c836b.png"/>
    </Frame>

  </Tab>
   <Tab title="Percentage">
      Select the percentage charge model if you want to apply a **percentage and a
      fixed fee on transactions** (e.g. bank transfers, ATM withdrawals, etc.).

      This charge model is generally used with billable metrics that allow users to
      calculate the total amount of transactions (e.g. `sum` aggregation type and
      `amount` defined as the event property -
      [learn more](/aggregation-types#2-sum)).

      You can define several parameters for the percentage charge model, including:

      - **Percentage rate**: charge rate that applies to the total amount (e.g. 1.2%
        on transactions);
      - **Fixed fee (optional)**: fee that applies to each event ingested during the
        billing period (e.g. $0.10 per transaction);
      - **Free units (events - optional)**: number of events that are not subject to
        the fixed fee; and
      - **Free units (total amount - optional)**: amount that is not subject to the
        charge rate.

      When free units are defined for both the total amount and number of events, Lago
      performs checks each time a new event is ingested to determine whether the free
      units still apply. In the illustration below for instance, the first 3 events or
      $500 are free.

      <Frame  caption="Configuration of the percentage charge model">
        <img src="/guide/plans/images/percentage-model-b2657bc04ac57c27cfe3bc3b830fd8dc.png"/>
      </Frame>

      Consider the following list of events:

      | Event         | Amount | Total number of events         | Total amount     | Result     |
      | ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------- |
      | Transaction 1 | $200   | 1 free event (out of 3)        | $200 ($500 free) | No charges |
      | Transaction 2 | $100   | 2 free events (out of 3)       | $300 ($500 free) | No charges |
      | Transaction 3 | $100   | 3 free events (out of 3)       | $400 ($500 free) | No charges |
      | Transaction 4 | $50    | 4 events (free units exceeded) | $450 ($500 free) | Charge     |

      Therefore, for the fourth transaction, the charge will be $0.10 x 1 event + 1.2%
      of $50 = $0.70.
  </Tab>
     <Tab title="Volume">
        Select the volume charge model if you want to define several price tiers but
        want to apply a **single unit price based on the total volume**. You can also
        apply a **flat fee** in addition to the unit price.

        Consider the following example, where each unit represents an API call:

        | Tier   | First unit | Last unit | Unit price | Fixed fee |
        | ------ | ---------- | --------- | ---------- | --------- |
        | Tier 1 | 0          | 10,000    | $0.0010    | $10       |
        | Tier 2 | 10,001     | 50,000    | $0.0008    | $10       |
        | Tier 3 | 50,001     | 100,000   | $0.0006    | $10       |
        | Tier 4 | 100,001    | ∞         | $0.0004    | $10       |

        In this case, 65,000 API calls would cost 65,000 x $0.0006 + $10 = $49.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Charge spending minimum[](#charge-spending-minimum "Direct link to heading")
<Info>**Premium feature ✨**: only users with a premium license can define a charge spending minimum. 
Please **[contact us](mailto:hello@getlago.com)** to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.</Info>

Usage-based charges are always paid at the end of the billing period, based on the amount of consumption that occurred. However, you 
could possibly need to define a spending minimum that a customer needs to commit to.

If your customer spends less than the committed amount, you will **charge a true-up fee equal to the difference between the commitment 
and the actual usage**. Please note that this true-up fee is tied to the initial charge but will appear as a separate line item in an 
invoice or in a credit note.

**Spending minimums and true-up fees are always prorated based on the number of days used in the subscription**. This ensures 
fairness if your customer signs up at the end of the month, upgrades to a new plan, or terminates an ongoing subscription 
before the end of the period.

In the example below, a customer is billed based on Monthly Tracked Users (MTU), with a standard pricing of $0.010 per tracked users. 
However, the customer is committed to a spending minimum of $100. If the total consumption of MTUs for the period is $50, a true-up fee 
of $50 will be charged.

To define a charge spending minimum:
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    1. Go to a **Plan**;
    2. Add a usage-based **charge**;
    3. Define a price model;

## Instant charges: not invoiceable[](#instant-charges "Direct link to heading")
<Info>**Premium feature ✨**: only users with a premium license can define whether or not a charge is invoiceable. 
Please **[contact us](mailto:hello@getlago.com)** to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.</Info>

If a charge needs to be `paid in advance`, you can choose whether or not it generates an invoice.

The `"invoiceable": false` option is **particularly relevant for fintech companies that want to charge customers instantly 
without issuing an invoice**. This feature can be useful for banking transactions like ATM withdrawals, FX transfers and other 
similar scenarios.

By setting the invoiceable parameter to false, you can streamline the payment process, eliminating the step of generating 
invoices for these specific charges.

To define if a charge is invoiceable or not: 
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    1. Go to a **Plan**;
    2. Add a usage-based **charge**;
    3. Define a price model;

## Delete a charge[](#delete-charge "Direct link to heading")

You may delete a charge included in a plan associated with existing
[subscriptions](/plans/subscriptions).

If you do so and save the change:

- The charge will be immediately removed from all subscriptions linked to this
  plan;
- The charge will no longer be included in the
  [current usage](/api/customer-usage/customer-usage-object) of the customers
  concerned; and
- The charge will be immediately removed from all `draft` invoices associated
  with these subscriptions.

However, the charge will still be included in all `finalized` invoices
associated with these subscriptions.

<Info>
  Deleting a charge does not delete the events associated with the corresponding
  billable metric. If later you decide to add the charge back into the plan, the
  events received before the deletion may be taken into account in the billing
  process (depending on the limits of the billing period).
