title: "Progressive billing"
description: "Progressive billing, also known as threshold billing, automatically triggers an invoice when a customer's cumulative usage reaches predefined thresholds. This method ensures that customers cannot exceed certain usage limits without ensuring payment is received, reducing the risk of unpaid services or fraud."

## Lifetime usage
In the context of progressive billing, thresholds and invoicing behavior are **determined by the lifetime usage of a subscription**. 
This approach means that Lago continuously tracks and aggregates **the total usage across all billing periods**. 
By considering this cumulative usage, Lago can accurately assess whether a customer has reached predefined thresholds.

When the lifime usage reaches a specific threshold, Lago automatically triggers the invoicing process, ensuring that usage is invoiced promptly before it exceeds the specified limits. This mechanism helps prevent overuse of services without corresponding invoice and payment, offering a safeguard against potential revenue leakage. 
It's important to note that lifetime usage is persistent across periods, meaning that even if a customer's usage fluctuates, Lago will account for the entire history to determine if and when an invoice should be issued.

## Setting up thresholds

For the progressive billing feature, you can configure two types of thresholds: Step-Based Thresholds and Recurring Thresholds.

### Step-Based thresholds
For Step-Based Thresholds, invoices are generated when the lifetime usage of a subscription reaches a defined threshold. 
You can set an unlimited number of thresholds, each with a specific amount and a unique name.

In the above example, Lago will issue an invoice when the specified threshold is met:

- `Invoice #1`: When the lifetime usage reaches $5;
- `Invoice #2`: When the lifetime usage reaches $20;
- `Invoice #3`: When the lifetime usage reaches $50;
- `Invoice #4`: When the lifetime usage reaches $100;
- `Invoice #5`: When the lifetime usage reaches $1,000;
- Then, resume to 'end of the month' billing.

### Recurring thresholds
In addition to Step-Based Thresholds, you can also set up a Recurring Threshold. This threshold determines what happens after the final step-based threshold is reached. 
If a recurring threshold is defined, Lago will continue to issue invoices each time the lifetime usage increases by the specified amount. 
For example, as shown in the image below, after the last threshold, Lago will automatically bill $100 each time the lifetime usage increments by that amount.
