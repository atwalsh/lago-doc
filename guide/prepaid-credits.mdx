title: "Prepaid credits"
description:
  "Since usage-based charges are calculated at the end of the billing period,
  you often need to wait to collect payments. With prepaid credits, you can now
  unlock recurring revenue opportunities for pay-as-you-go pricing models."

Prepaid credits increase predictability as they allow you to collect payments in
advance and then monitor the evolution of the balance of your customer's
wallets.

    Free credits are added to the customer's wallet instantly, while purchased
    credits are added to the wallet when payment is confirmed (see below).

    Each customer can only have one active wallet.

## Credit purchases and top-ups[](#credit-purchases-and-top-ups "Direct link to heading")

Lago automatically generates an invoice for each purchase. Taxes do not apply to
credit purchases, which are considered as advance payments.

Payment must be made in order for credits to be added to the customer's wallet
(i.e. the status of the invoice must be `succeeded`).

## Application scope[](#application-scope "Direct link to heading")

Prepaid credits are deducted from the subtotal of the next invoice(s), after
tax.

![Invoice partially paid with prepaid credits](/guide/images/prepaid-credits-invoice-ecd9e8ad653b516efb08c6b48e1e48fe.png)

<Info>Prepaid credits do not apply to one-off invoices.</Info>

## Expiration date and termination[](#expiration-date-and-termination "Direct link to heading")

By default, if you don't set an expiration date, prepaid credits are carried
over to the next billing period until the wallet balance is zero.

If you define an expiration date, when the date is reached, all remaining
credits are **automatically voided**.

To modify the expiration date of the prepaid credits through the user interface:

1. Open the **"Wallets"** tab and click **"Edit wallet"** on the right;
2. Select **"Edit information"**;
3. Modify the expiration date; and
4. Click **"Edit information"** to confirm.

The expiration date displayed in the app is based on the organization's timezone.

You also have the ability to terminate a wallet manually, before its expiration
date:

1. Open the **"Wallets"** tab and click **"Edit wallet"** on the right;
2. Select **"Terminate wallet"**; and
3. Click again to confirm.

<Warning>
  Terminating a wallet will instantly void all remaining credits. This action
  **cannot be undone**.
</Warning>
